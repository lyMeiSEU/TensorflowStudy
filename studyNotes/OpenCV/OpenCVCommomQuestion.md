> ## 为什么cv2.waitkey(0)后要加 & 0xff
> * 高位的2个字节由Shift, Control, Num lock等状态表示，为了消除他们的影响统一用& 0xff清除这些信息。

>The answers which have already been posted suggest that some of the unusual values obtained by waitKey are due to platform differences. Below, I propose that (at least on some platforms) the apparently odd behaviour of waitKey is due to keyboard modifiers. This post looks similar to Tomasz's answer because I initially wrote this as an edit, which was rejected.\
>The keycodes returned by waitKey change depending on which modifiers are enabled. NumLock, CapsLock, and the Shift, Ctrl, and Alt keys all modify the keycode returned by waitKey by enabling certain bits above the two Least Significant Bytes. The smallest of these flags is Shift at 0x10000.\
> A modified version of the script Tomasz posted is given below:
``` py
#!/usr/bin/env python
import cv2
import sys
cv2.imshow(sys.argv[1], cv2.imread(sys.argv[1]))
res = cv2.waitKey(0)
print('You pressed %d (0x%x), 2LSB: %d (%s)' % (res, res, res % 2**16,repr(chr(res%256)) if res%256 < 128 else '?'))
    # Which give the following results:
    # q letter with NumLock:
    # You pressed 1048689 (0x100071), 2LSB: 113 ('q')
    # Escape key with CapsLock but not NumLock:
    # You pressed 131099 (0x2001b), 2LSB: 27 ('\x1b')
    # Space with Shift and NumLock:
    # You pressed 1114144 (0x110020), 2LSB: 32 (' ')
    # Right Arrow Key with Control, NumLock off:
    # You pressed 327507 (0x4ff53), 2LSB: 65363 ('S')
```
> I hope that helps to explain the unusual behaviour of waitKey and how to get the actual key pressed regardless of the state of NumLock and CapLock. From here it's relatively simple to do something like:
> ```
> ctrlPressed = 0 != res & (1 << 18)

> ...as the "control key" flag is bit 19. Shift is at bit 17, the state of CapsLock at bit 18, Alt is at bit 20, and NumLock is at bit 21.
